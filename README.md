fsrm-quotas-backup
==================

Quotas backup script for MS Windows File Server Resource Management

Usage:

.\quotas_backup.vbs - launch on old server (from which quotas are going to migrate)

.\folders_copy.bat <Destination_folder> - launch on old server (from which quotas
are going to migrate) to copy target folders to a new server.
Example: .\folders_copy.bat \\\new-server\d$

.\quotas_create.bat - launch on new server (to which quotas are going to migrate)


Run quotas_backup.vbs on server from which you are willing to move quotas.
It will generate 3 files:

1) quota_templates.xml - contains quotas templates exported by "dirquota template export";

2) all_quotas.txt - contains quotas list generated by "dirquota q l";

3) quotas_create.bat - batch file with commands to create quotas on a new server;

4) folders_copy.bat - batch file with commands to copy target folders to a new server;


After that you should copy (or move) target folders to a new server and then
you need to edit path to target folders in file quotas_create.bat. Now you
should launch quotas_create.bat on new server and patiently wait for it to do
it's magic.
